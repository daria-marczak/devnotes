# Command line

## Basics
``pwd`` will show us in which we are currently

``rm`` will remove a file, but it's a final delete so it's beter not to use it. It will remove it permamently, not put it into trash. It's better to use trash. You should actually go to [Trash](https://github.com/sindresorhus/trash) and install the dependency globally. Using ``trash <fileName>`` will remove the file and move it to trash.

To escape a space in bash use ``Something \<space>  something``.

ZSH allows us to actually do ``mkdir folder`` and ``cd folder`` in one step using ``take folder``.

If we start typing a command, let's say ``git `` it will look for the command that we have used previously when we hit up or down arrow.
